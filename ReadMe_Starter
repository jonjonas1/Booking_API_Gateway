READ ME: Booking API Gateway
	Spring cloud API Gateway: its single entry point to multiple microservices. 
	An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for a collection of microservices. 
	Its like a proxy that routes the request to the appropriate microservices and returns response to the client. 
	Any external client cannot access the microservices directly but can access them only through the application gateway
